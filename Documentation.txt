Geometry2d
Contains several classes to perform geometry calculations, specifically Points, Segments, and Polygons.
All Polygons are by definition closed polys, but there is not restriction on concave/convex.
All distance measurements use distance squared to avoid the overhead of repeatedly calculating sqrts.
The Utils class provides some static methods to simplify interacting with the geometry api, particularly
by overloading the distance() function so that the end user doesn't need to remember which object
can measure distance to other objects.
All angles use East as 0 degrees, North as 90, and South as -90.
